We implemented a Q-learning algorithm that aims to find randomly selected erroneous nodes in a strongly connected directed graph. The models are also randomized based on the user-defined parameters. Project is carried out within the scope of Sabancı University - Project for Undergraduate Research in 2019 Fall semester, with the supervision of Associate Professor Cemal Yılmaz.
